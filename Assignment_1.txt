   Answer : We can use Import keyword or else we can User From plus Import togethe import is referenced for modules and From is used for referenceing the packages 



5. What is wrong with the following code?

	def int,int SumAndDivide(int a, int b):    
    		c = a + b
   	 	d = a/b
    		return c,d

   Answer : we are divinding a/b to get d but we are not expection handiling some of the cases where b may = 0 , Annotations decleraction is different from expected 


6. What is the output of the following code?

   for letter in 'Python': 
      if letter == 'h':
         pass
         print 'This is pass block'
      print 'Current Letter :', letter

      Current Letter : P
      Current Letter : y
      Current Letter : t
      Current Letter : h
      Current Letter : o
      Current Letter : n


   for letter in 'Python': 
      if letter == 'h':
         continue
         print 'This is continue block'
      print 'Current Letter :', letter


      Current Letter : P
      Current Letter : y
      Current Letter : t
      Current Letter : o
      Current Letter : n

   
   for letter in 'Python': 
      if letter == 'h':
         break
         print 'This is break block'
      print 'Current Letter :', letter

      Current Letter : P
      Current Letter : y
      Current Letter : t
 

7.Write program to find the first non-repeating character in a sorted string (E.g:'AAAAABBBCDDDEEEE' => 'C')

   Answer :
      def NonRepeating(s):
      for i in range(len(s)):
         if s.count(s[i]) == 1:
               return s[i]
      return None

   string = input("Enter a string: ")
   print(NonRepeating(string))

8. What is the output of the program?
class A(object):
      def hello(self):
          print 'It is class A'
 
class B(A):
      def hello(self):
          print 'It is class B'
 
class C(A,B):
      def hello(self):
          print 'It is class C'
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
   c = C()
   c.hello()

   Answer: It is class C

9.What is __init__.py? Give an example of where you would use it.
   Answer : When we have multiple modules in a Directory  to convert it into a python Package we usually place an empty __init__.py file to convert it into python module 


10.Write Fibonacci series in more than one way.

   #Using recursion 
   def fibonacci_recursive(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 0
  elif n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)

# Example usage
for i in range(10):
  print(fibonacci_recursive(i))

#Iteration using 2 varables

def fibonacci_iterative(n):
  a, b = 0, 1
  for _ in range(n):
    a, b = b, a + b
  return a

# Example usage
for i in range(10):
  print(fibonacci_iterative(i))
